# Royal Rumble Wrestler Generator
Random simulator for Royal Rumble wrestlers to produce a fantasy football draft order.

### Notes
- Random seed set by league vote.

### Rules
The ten members of the league are each assigned 3 wrestlers for a simulated Royal Rumble. Because
the Royal Rumble cannot preemptively set this, we use a random number generator to assign 'places'
to each league member. The order of wrestlers is then set by the order that they enter the ring,
which introduces additional stochastiscity.
